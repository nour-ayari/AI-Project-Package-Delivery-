This project implements an artificial intelligence delivery system operating on a city modeled as a 2D grid. A set of delivery trucks must transport packages from multiple stores 
to multiple customer destinations while minimizing travel time. Roads may contain traffic levels (costs), blocked segments, and optional tunnels connecting distant points.
